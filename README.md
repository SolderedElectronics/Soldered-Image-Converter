## Overview

Soldered Image Converter is a desktop application which converts .png, .jpg, or .bmp format pictures (up to 10 at a time) to C++ compatible Arduino/Dasduino code, which you can use for your Soldered Displays. Now it's easy to convert images to byte arrays and display them on your embedded projects!

The app is written in Python, the GUI is made in PySide6 (QT Designer).
